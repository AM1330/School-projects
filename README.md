Dear colleagues, fellow students in the Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineer UTH

This is my legacy for the department. 
During my studies, I always wanted to save time in order to focus on what i really care. Entrepreneurship and giving back to the community.

In this repo you will not find perfect projects but projects with enough quality to relieve you from the stress to pass a subject.
Keep in mind that everything comes at a cost. You will save time but you will lose knowledge.
Use this time wisely to create other useful things by applying the same principles that you would apply if you had to make the project from scratch.

Give peace a chance,
Alex
